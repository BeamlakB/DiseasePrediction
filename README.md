# DiseasePrediction Model

Throughout the past 20 years, people have browsed the web for health information to understand their symptoms and explore possible diagnoses. These tools empower patients to advocate for themselves and soothe anxiety and stress associated with health concerns. However, these websites can often provide misleading or incorrect information. As a result, patients might adopt harmful practices or treatments, delaying proper medical care.

## Project Goal

Our goal is to create a solution that provides trustworthy health information. We have developed a model that offers a concise list of diseases that may describe the given symptoms. 

### Example Symptom

- **Symptom:** "My skin has been breaking out in a terrible rash lately. Blackheads and pus-filled pimples abound on it. Additionally, my skin has been scurrying a lot."
- **Diagnosis:** **Acne**

## Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a model using patient-reported symptoms to predict potential diseases, offering individuals guidance on their health concerns before medical consultation.

### Data Collection and Processing

We gathered data from diverse sources, such as electronic health records and medical literature repositories. This data was meticulously pre-processed to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Model Development

We utilized the LLAMA large language model for symptom extraction through prompt engineering. At the heart of our approach is Information Retrieval, which we use to identify correlations between symptom combinations and diseases.

### Objective

Ultimately, our goal is to empower individuals with actionable insights into their health, fostering proactive healthcare and ensuring patients are better informed when seeking medical consultation.
